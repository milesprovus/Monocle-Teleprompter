This project is based on [Brilliant AR Studio](https://github.com/brilliantlabsAR/ar-studio-for-vscode). 

This is a proof-of-concept separation of the bluetooth communication logic for the Monocle device, which can be used in other NodeJS projects or as a standalone CLI REPL programmer for the device.

Currently it's not published on NPM, but can be directly included via Github. For an usage example, see:
